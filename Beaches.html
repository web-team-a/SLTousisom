                    <p>
                        Best east coast beaches sri lanka.
Hidden away on the east coast of Sri Lanka just north of Trincomalee town lies Nilaveli Beach, the best beach in Trincomalee.

It’s often overshadowed by the more popular Uppuveli Beach, which is just a short drive away. But those who make the effort to explore Nilaveli Beach will be rewarded with a secluded and picturesque stretch of shoreline.

The soft sand and clear waters coupled with the palms trees that line the beach make it one of the best family beaches in Sri Lanka, couples and those travellers looking to escape the crowds.

If you’re a surfer, you’ll have to go elsewhere as there are no waves in Nilaveli Beach and the water is more conducive for those who want to laze in the calm, flat waters, and spend their days soaking up the sun whilst sipping on a fresh coconuts.

Things to do near Nilaveli Beach
Just a stone’s throw away from Nilaveli Beach lies Pigeon Island National Park, one of the best places to go snorkeling and with some of the best diving in Sri Lanka.

Unfortunately, the reef was damaged by the 2004 tsunami and uncontrolled tourism has also had a ripple effect on the marine life and coral surrounding Pigeon Island.

The best time to visit the Sri Lanka east coast beaches is from May to September when the weather is warm and sunny, with no rain showers.

Spending a few days in Nilaveli Beach will give you a true island experience, and is guaranteed to be one of your highlights of Sri Lanka

                    <h2>02.Jungle Beach</h2>
                    <dev class="heading"><font size="3px" color="yellow">One of the best beaches near Galle</font></dev>
                    <p>
                        Sri Lanka is known for its pristine and romantic beaches. But there’s one beach hidden from regular beachgoers – the Jungle Beach in Unawatuna.

As the name suggests, the beach is actually surrounded by a small jungle. This one is for those who want to experience adventure and beach vibes at the same time.

Jungle Beach is a tiny bay area well hidden from the usual hubbub of Unawatuna city.

Visiting this little isolated haven is definitely among the best things to do in Unawatuna. Due to being less crowded, the beach, as well as the water, is super clean.

The best part is reaching the beach itself. The entrance to the beach is through a rather narrow and steep path that will take you to a sign with the name of the beach on it, painted on a rock.

It’s a short, but a rather adventurous hike across a few rocky hills of the Rumassala Mountains.

A small detour before reaching the beach will take you to a secluded rock-beach with lots of crabs and the deep blue Indian ocean will be just a few meters away!!

Apparently, the Jungle Beach itself remained secluded until very recently because a fairly challenging hike was required to reach it. Latterly, a muddy path was carved out to save visitors the fear of getting lost in the jungle!

The beach has since then seen more crowds visit. A small eatery has been set up on Jungle Beach and a number of sunbeds are available.

The eatery serves Sri Lankan snacks, as well as sandwiches and chilled drinks. If you want a bit of seclusion all you have to do is to keep walking away from the sunbeds.

                    <h2>03.Unawatuna Beach</h2>
                    <dev class="heading"><font size="3px" color="yellow">Best family beaches in Sri Lanka.</font></dev>
                    <p>
                        Unawatuna is a long beach on the Southern coast of Sri Lanka close to Galle.

It is backed by palm trees, with fabulously clear water and golden sand and is one of the most popular Sri Lanka beach holiday destinations.

There’s plenty to do both on Unawatuna beach and nearby. From snorkelling and swimming to relaxing on sunbeds to rent and lots of places for kids to play.

Although the waters are relatively calm, you can still learn to surf too. It’s a great place for kids to learn before progressing on to the bigger waves at Tangalle and Weligama.

At the far end of the beach, you can walk up a small set of steps to a Japanese peace pagoda and buddha statue with fantastic views across the whole beach and out towards Galle.

If you fancy some shopping, there’s a long street running from the middle of the beach full of independent shops selling souvenirs, traditional clothes and snacks.

My top tip is to get up early for a morning swim when the water is calm, and the sun glistens onto the sea.

Best time to visit Unawatuna Beach
The weather is most stable between October – April, with the driest months being from February – April.

                    <dev class="heading"><font size="3px" color="yellow">Best Surf in Sri Lanka.</font></dev>
                    <p>Arugam Bay, also known as A’Bay, is on the less visited East Coast of Sri Lanka.

                        Located just north of Yala National Park, Arugam Bay is most well known for being the best place to surf in Sri Lanka and the area has a few different beaches to surf at.
                        
                        Elephant Point is at the Southern end of Arugam Beach and popular for surf lessons for beginners. Whiskey Point and Peanut Farm are popular for more experienced surfers.
                        
                        Things to do near Arugam Bay Beach,
                        If surfing isn’t your thing, don’t worry you can still enjoy some the Sri Lanka east coast beaches as there are plenty more things to do in Arugam Bay.
                        
                        Due to its hippy and chilled out vibe yoga is on offer and there are lots of healthy cafes to visit too.
                        
                        It’s very close to Kumana National Park which is part of Yala East National Park so you can do a day trip from Arugam Bay to see leopards and elephants!
                        
                        Best time to visit Arugam Bay,
                        The best time of year to visit Arugam Bay is May to September, which is opposite to the popular south coast Sri Lanka beaches.
                        
                        This is another one of its unique points and why it’s one of the best beaches in Sri Lanka because it’s peak time is during Sri Lanka’s offseason which creates an even more chilled out atmosphere in this already chilled-out surfer town.

                            <p>
                                Sri Lanka’s southern coast is lined with beautiful beaches, but one of the best is Weligama.

What makes Weligama beach so great is that it’s the perfect place to learn to surf in Sri Lanka.

The waves in Weligama bay are perfect for beginners, but if you paddle further out there are some bigger waves for more advanced surfers.

There are over 30 surf schools within a 500m radius in Weligama, so there’s no shortage of professional lessons for those wanting to learn.

Elsewhere Surf and Yoga Camps is a great place to stay if you’re looking for a surf camp.

Things to do near Weligama Beach,
